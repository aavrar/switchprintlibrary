SWITCH PRINT LIBRARY PLAN

1. Core Idea
Build a simple AI-powered tool that remembers how a bilingual or multilingual user switches languages across conversations and adapts accordingly. It’s about personalization through code-switching awareness.

2. Key Components
Language Identification: Detect which language(s) each chunk of text is in.

Embedding & Memory: Store conversation snippets as vector embeddings so the system can recall past linguistic patterns.

Retrieval: Given new input, find related past inputs to influence the conversation style or output.

User Interface: A simple interface for users to input text and see adaptive responses or memory highlights.

3. Tech Stack (Minimal & Free)
Python (main programming language)

Language detection: langdetect or Facebook’s fastText language ID model

Embeddings: Use pretrained sentence-transformer models from Hugging Face (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Vector similarity search: FAISS (open-source, runs locally) for indexing and retrieving similar embeddings

Interface:

CLI (command-line interface) with Python’s input() for early prototypes

Or a simple web UI using Streamlit or Flask

Deployment:

Local machine for development

Optional: deploy on free tiers like Heroku or Streamlit sharing for demos

4. Stepwise Development
Step 1: Language Detection

Accept a line of text input from the user.

Run it through the language detection library to output detected languages.

Print or highlight code-switch points (e.g., “this sentence is 40% Hindi, 60% English”).

Step 2: Embedding Generation

Pass each input through a pretrained sentence-transformer to generate a vector embedding.

Store these embeddings in a simple list or database (e.g., SQLite).

Step 3: Build a Vector Search

Use FAISS to index the stored embeddings.

When new input arrives, generate its embedding and query FAISS for the most similar past inputs.

Step 4: Retrieval & Response

Retrieve the closest previous inputs.

Design a simple rule-based or GPT-prompted response that reflects the style or language pattern of the retrieved inputs.

For example, if past inputs mixed Hindi and English in a certain ratio, mimic that.

Step 5: User Interface

Wrap this in a simple web app (Streamlit or Flask).

Show the user their input, detected languages, and a response adapting to their style.

5. Realistic MVP Scope
No need for perfect UI or full conversational AI at first.

Focus on proof-of-concept: “EchoThread knows my code-switching style and tries to reflect it.”

You can demo with a handful of example inputs and outputs.

6. Why It Matters
Shows your understanding of NLP pipelines, vector search, and conversational AI.

Demonstrates culturally aware AI—a fast-growing, underserved area.

A portfolio piece that blends technical execution with human nuance.

7. Possible Extensions (Once MVP works)
Integrate with an actual chatbot (GPT-based) to generate adaptive, style-matched responses.

Add support for more languages or dialects.

Visualize the evolution of a user’s language patterns over time.

Give the user control over what gets remembered.

Let them delete or annotate past interactions.

Make transparency a design principle from day one.

A memory-augmented layer that tracks how a user code-switches over time and uses that to personalize chatbot responses."

Core Idea
Build an AI-powered conversational memory system that not only detects but models and remembers a bilingual or multilingual user's unique code-switching patterns over time. Instead of simple language identification or ratio mimicry, the system captures linguistic style, switch points, and sociolinguistic cues, adapting chatbot responses to reflect the user’s personalized language-mixing behavior. This enables deep personalization through sustained linguistic identity awareness.

Key Components and Innovations
Advanced Language Identification and Segmentation

Use state-of-the-art multi-level language ID models to detect languages at fine granularity, including sentence-level and intra-sentence switch points.

Incorporate hierarchical segmentation to identify code-switch boundaries consistent with sociolinguistic theories (e.g., Matrix Language Frame).

Enhancement: Move beyond simple language detection (like langdetect or fastText) to a customized switch point detection module trained or adapted for code-switch data.

Multi-Modal Embedding & Persistent Memory

Generate multi-view embeddings combining:

Semantic embeddings (sentence-transformer vectors).

Style embeddings capturing switching frequency, language entropy, and sociolinguistic features.

User/session metadata embeddings.

Store these in a scalable vector database (e.g., FAISS) augmented with symbolic metadata indexing.

Enhancement: Use multi-modal embeddings rather than plain sentence embeddings to capture nuanced style information.

Retrieval with Hybrid Similarity Metrics

Implement hybrid search combining vector similarity with symbolic filters on language-switching metadata to retrieve the most stylistically relevant past inputs.

Use retrieved context to model user style over multiple conversations.

Enhancement: Hybrid retrieval strategies improve relevance over purely vector-based methods.

Style-Adaptive Response Generation

Develop adaptive prompting or fine-tuned generation models (GPT-family or equivalent) that incorporate retrieved memory of the user’s code-switching style.

Responses emulate the user’s typical language mixing ratios, switching points, and lexical preferences dynamically.

Provide rule-based fallback mechanisms for initial prototypes.

Enhancement: Move beyond ratio mimicry to generative style adaptation conditioned on persistent memory.

Transparent, User-Centric Interface

A web-based UI (Streamlit or Flask) displaying:

User input with highlighted detected languages and switch points.

Visualization of the user’s evolving code-switching style profile over time.

Display of retrieved memory snippets influencing current responses.

User controls to edit, annotate, or delete past conversation memory, enhancing privacy and trust.

Enhancement: Emphasis on transparency, user control, and sociolinguistically informed visualization.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python

Language Identification: Fine-tuned or hierarchical language-switch detection module (custom or adapted from research models).

Embeddings: Multi-modal embedding architecture combining pretrained sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) with style and metadata vectors.

Response Generation: GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 API with dynamic prompt engineering, or fine-tuned transformer models for style adaptation.

Interface: Streamlit or Flask with advanced visualization libraries (Plotly, D3.js).

Storage: SQLite or lightweight DB for metadata, vector DB for embeddings.

Deployment: Local dev environment with optional cloud deployment on scalable platforms respecting data privacy.
