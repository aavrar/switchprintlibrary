# Test Results Analysis

This document details the failed tests, their probable causes, and proposed solutions.

## Failed Tests Summary

### 1. `tests/test_ensemble_detector.py::TestEnsembleDetector::test_basic_ensemble_detection`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: 'es' not found in ['en', 'pt']`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/ensemble_detector.py` and `tests/test_ensemble_detector.py`
- **Why it failed:** The ensemble detector, which combines results from multiple individual language detectors, failed to correctly identify Spanish ('es') in a test case where it was expected. The test likely asserted that 'es' should be present in the detected languages, but the ensemble only returned 'en' and 'pt'. This could be due to an issue with how the ensemble aggregates results, or a weakness in one of its constituent detectors for Spanish.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Inspect Ensemble Logic:** Review `codeswitch_ai/detection/ensemble_detector.py` to ensure the logic for combining language detection results is robust and correctly handles cases where multiple languages are present or expected.
    2.  **Verify Constituent Detectors:** Check the performance of individual detectors (e.g., `fasttext_detector.py`, `transformer_detector.py`) within the ensemble for Spanish language detection. Ensure they are correctly configured and performing as expected.
    3.  **Review Test Data/Assertion:** Confirm that the input data for `test_basic_ensemble_detection` is a clear example of text containing Spanish. Also, verify if the assertion in the test accurately reflects the expected behavior of the ensemble detector. It might be that the ensemble is correctly identifying other languages, and the test's expectation needs adjustment if 'es' is not always guaranteed to be the primary detection.

### 2. `tests/test_fasttext_detector.py::TestFastTextDetector::test_basic_language_detection`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: 0.1520957201719284 not greater than 0.5`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/fasttext_detector.py` and `tests/test_fasttext_detector.py`
- **Why it failed:** The FastText language detector returned a confidence score (0.152...) below the required threshold of 0.5 for a basic language detection test. This indicates that the model was not sufficiently confident in its prediction for the given input.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Model Verification:** Ensure the FastText model loaded in `codeswitch_ai/detection/fasttext_detector.py` is appropriate for the task and correctly trained for the languages being tested.
    2.  **Test Input Quality:** Review the input text used in `test_basic_language_detection`. Is it a clear and unambiguous example of the language it's supposed to detect?
    3.  **Threshold Adjustment:** Consider if the confidence threshold of 0.5 in the test is too strict for the FastText model's typical output. If the model is generally accurate but produces lower confidence scores, the threshold might need to be lowered.
    4.  **Model Retraining/Fine-tuning:** If the model consistently produces low confidence scores for valid inputs, it might require retraining or fine-tuning with more diverse data.

### 3. `tests/test_fasttext_detector.py::TestFastTextDetector::test_preprocessing`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: 0.33180004358291626 not greater than 0.5`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/fasttext_detector.py` and `tests/test_fasttext_detector.py`
- **Why it failed:** Similar to the previous FastText failure, the confidence score (0.331...) after a preprocessing step was below the 0.5 threshold. This suggests that the preprocessing might be negatively impacting the FastText model's ability to confidently detect the language, or the threshold is still too high.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Preprocessing Review:** Examine the preprocessing logic applied before FastText detection in `codeswitch_ai/detection/fasttext_detector.py` (or any utility functions it calls). Ensure that preprocessing steps (e.g., tokenization, normalization) are not inadvertently removing or altering crucial linguistic features that FastText relies on for accurate detection.
    2.  **Test Input and Threshold:** Re-evaluate the test input for `test_preprocessing` and consider adjusting the confidence threshold if it's overly stringent.
    3.  **Preprocessing Impact Analysis:** Analyze the output of the preprocessing step to see if it's producing the expected input for the FastText model.

### 4. `tests/test_gemini_detection.py::test_is_multilingual_true`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: assert False is True`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/transformer_detector.py` (assuming Gemini integration here) and `tests/test_gemini_detection.py`
- **Why it failed:** The `is_multilingual` function, which presumably uses the Gemini model, returned `False` when the test expected `True`. This indicates that the Gemini-based detection failed to correctly identify a multilingual input as such.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Gemini Integration Review:** Inspect the implementation of `is_multilingual` in `codeswitch_ai/detection/transformer_detector.py` (or the relevant module handling Gemini API calls). Ensure the prompt engineering for Gemini is effective in eliciting multilingual detection.
    2.  **Test Data Validation:** Verify that the input data for `test_is_multilingual_true` is a clear and unambiguous example of multilingual text.
    3.  **API Response Parsing:** Confirm that the response from the Gemini API is correctly parsed and interpreted to determine multilingualism. The model's output format might have changed or is being misinterpreted.
    4.  **Prompt Refinement:** Experiment with different prompts for the Gemini model to guide it towards better multilingual identification.

### 5. `tests/test_gemini_detection.py::test_detect_word_level_switches`
- **Error:** `assert False`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/transformer_detector.py` (assuming Gemini integration here) and `tests/test_gemini_detection.py`
- **Why it failed:** A direct `assert False` indicates that a critical condition within the test or the function being tested was not met, leading to an explicit failure. This points to a fundamental issue in the word-level code-switch detection logic using Gemini.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Detailed Debugging:** Step through the `test_detect_word_level_switches` and the corresponding function in `codeswitch_ai/detection/transformer_detector.py`. Identify the exact line or condition that leads to the `assert False`.
    2.  **Tokenization and Language ID:** Verify that the word-level tokenization and subsequent language identification for each token are working correctly. Incorrect tokenization or misidentification of individual word languages would lead to incorrect switch detection.
    3.  **Switch Detection Logic:** Review the logic that determines a "switch" based on word-level language tags. Ensure it accurately captures the definition of a code-switch.
    4.  **Gemini Output Interpretation:** If Gemini is providing word-level language tags, ensure its output is correctly parsed and used by the detection logic.

### 6. `tests/test_gemini_detection.py::test_no_switches`
- **Error:** `assert 4 == 0`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/transformer_detector.py` (assuming Gemini integration here) and `tests/test_gemini_detection.py`
- **Why it failed:** The test expected zero code-switches but the Gemini-based detector identified four. This indicates a high rate of false positives in the code-switch detection when no switches are present.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **False Positive Reduction:** Focus on refining the Gemini prompt or the post-processing of its output to reduce false positives. The model might be over-sensitive to minor linguistic variations or misinterpreting certain patterns as switches.
    2.  **Contextual Analysis:** Ensure the detection logic considers the broader context of the sentence or utterance to avoid flagging natural language variations as code-switches.
    3.  **Thresholding/Filtering:** Implement or adjust confidence thresholds or filtering mechanisms to discard low-confidence "switches" that might be false positives.

### 7. `tests/test_integration.py::TestIntegration::test_ensemble_with_memory_integration`
- **Error:** `TypeError: ConversationMemory.store_conversation() got an unexpected keyword argument 'text'`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/memory/conversation_memory.py` and `tests/test_integration.py`
- **Why it failed:** The `store_conversation` method of the `ConversationMemory` class was called with a `text` keyword argument, but the method's signature does not accept such an argument. This is an API mismatch between the test and the `ConversationMemory` class.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **API Alignment:** Examine the `store_conversation` method in `codeswitch_ai/memory/conversation_memory.py`. Identify the correct parameters it expects (e.g., `utterance`, `speaker`, `timestamp`, `language_info`).
    2.  **Update Test Call:** Modify the call to `store_conversation` in `test_ensemble_with_memory_integration` to use the correct argument names and pass the appropriate data. If the intention was to store the raw text, the `ConversationMemory` class might need to be updated to accept a `text` argument, or the test should adapt to the existing API.

### 8. `tests/test_integration.py::TestIntegration::test_error_handling`
- **Error:** `TypeError: ConversationMemory.store_conversation() got an unexpected keyword argument 'text'`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/memory/conversation_memory.py` and `tests/test_integration.py`
- **Why it failed:** Same API mismatch as above.
- **How to fix:** Apply the same fix as for `test_ensemble_with_memory_integration`. The `store_conversation` method call in `test_error_handling` needs to be updated to match the actual signature of the method in `ConversationMemory`.

### 9. `tests/test_integration.py::TestIntegration::test_memory_and_retrieval_integration`
- **Error:** `TypeError: ConversationMemory.store_conversation() got an unexpected keyword argument 'text'`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/memory/conversation_memory.py` and `tests/test_integration.py`
- **Why it failed:** Same API mismatch as above.
- **How to fix:** Apply the same fix as for `test_ensemble_with_memory_integration`. The `store_conversation` method call in `test_memory_and_retrieval_integration` needs to be updated to match the actual signature of the method in `ConversationMemory`.

### 10. `tests/test_language_detection.py::test_multilingual_sentence_detection`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: assert 'english' in ['es', 'en', 'de', 'fr', 'hi', 'hu']`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/language_detector.py` and `tests/test_language_detection.py`
- **Why it failed:** The test expected the full language name 'english' to be present in the list of detected languages, but the detector returned ISO 639-1 codes (e.g., 'en', 'es'). This is primarily a mismatch in the expected output format between the test and the language detector.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Align Output Formats:** Decide whether the `language_detector.py` should return full language names or ISO codes.
        *   **If ISO codes are intended:** Change the test assertion to `assert 'en' in ['es', 'en', 'de', 'fr', 'hi', 'hu']`. This is generally preferred for consistency and machine readability.
        *   **If full names are intended:** Modify `language_detector.py` to map ISO codes to full language names before returning the results.
    2.  **Verify English Detection:** Ensure that the underlying language detection mechanism correctly identifies English when present in multilingual sentences.

### 11. `tests/test_optimized_detector.py::TestOptimizedCodeSwitchDetector::test_function_word_detection`
- **Error:** `AssertionError: 'fr' not found in ['it'] : Expected fr in ['it'] for 'le chat'`
- **Stem:** `codeswitch_ai/detection/optimized_detector.py` and `tests/test_optimized_detector.py`
- **Why it failed:** The optimized code-switch detector failed to identify 'fr' (French) for the input phrase "le chat" (which is French), instead incorrectly detecting 'it' (Italian). This indicates a specific weakness in the detector's ability to correctly identify French, particularly for common function words.
- **How to fix:**
    1.  **Function Word Lists:** Review the function word lists or linguistic rules used by the `optimized_detector.py`. Ensure that French function words like "le" are correctly included and associated with the French language.
    2.  **Language Model Accuracy:** If the optimized detector relies on a language model, verify its accuracy for French, especially for short phrases or individual words.
    3.  **Detection Logic Refinement:** Examine the logic within `optimized_detector.py` that processes function words and determines language. It might need refinement to better distinguish between similar languages or to prioritize more accurate language identification for short, common words.
    4.  **Test Data Expansion:** Consider adding more diverse French (and other language) function word examples to the test suite to ensure broader coverage.
